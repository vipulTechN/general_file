                <p>Renting is a huge headache. When renting, you only have a rental contract that expires
                  after 1 or 2 years. Second, it will be difficult to move because you are still in debt with
                  house prices. <br><br>Besides there are a lot of financial benefits for buying homes. Property value
                  increases
                  over time to time as it is an investment and provides you with the double benefit of
                  having property that is yours and renting out the house which generates some extra
                  monthly income for you. There is an exemption to Income Tax on the annual gain from
                  selling a house, so this is a major factor for those who are looking at starting a business.</p>
